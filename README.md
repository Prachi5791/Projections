# **Orthographic & Perspective Projections Viewer**

A web application for interactive visualization of **3D shapes** with both **orthographic** and **perspective projections**. Users can select, manipulate, and study geometric shapes, toggle grid/wireframe settings, and experience real-time adjustment of vanishing points in different perspective modes.

## **Demo Overview**
**Orthographic & Perspective Projections Viewer** is a visual learning tool that allows users to:

- Select different 3D shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, dodecahedron, torus knot, etc.)
- Switch between orthographic and **one-, two-, and three-point perspective** modes
- Interactively move vanishing points and see changes in real time
- Toggle grid, wireframe, and boundary overlays to enhance understanding

## **Features**
- **Wide Shape Selection:** Choose from a variety of geometric solids and parametric forms.
- **Multi-Panel Layout:** Instantly view a shape in 3D perspective, top, front, and side orthographic projections.
- **Perspective Simulation:** Adjust 1-, 2-, and 3-point vanishing points with sliders and observe live updates.
- **UI Controls:** Toggle grid, wireframe, and boundaries to suit your visualization needs.
- **Educational Tooltips:** Helpful text and instructions for learning and experimentation.
