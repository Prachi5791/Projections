A web application for interactive visualization of **3D shapes** featuring both **orthographic** and **perspective projections**. Users can select, manipulate, and study geometric shapes, toggle grid/wireframe/boundary settings, and experience real-time adjustment of vanishing points in different perspective modes. With intuitive controls and multiple viewing options, this tool is ideal for education and exploration in graphics, engineering, and design fields.

## **Demo Overview**
**Orthographic & Perspective Projections Viewer** is a visual learning tool that allows users to:

- Select different 3D shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, dodecahedron, torus knot, etc.)
- Switch between orthographic and **one-, two-, and three-point perspective** modes
- Interactively move vanishing points and see changes in real time
- Toggle grid, wireframe, and boundary overlays to enhance understanding

## **Features**
- **Wide Shape Selection:** Choose from a variety of geometric solids and parametric forms.
- **Multi-Panel Layout:** Instantly view a shape in 3D perspective, top, front, and side orthographic projections.
- **Perspective Simulation:** Adjust 1-, 2-, and 3-point vanishing points with sliders and observe live updates.
- **UI Controls:** Toggle grid, wireframe, and boundaries to suit your visualization needs.
- **Educational Tooltips:** Helpful text and instructions for learning and experimentation.

  - ortho.html ->   # Orthographic projections view
  - pres.html  ->   # Perspective projections/vanishing point controls
  - script.js  ->   # Main logic for 3D rendering and UI
  - style.css  ->   # Styles and layout

## **Getting Started**
1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   git clone https://github.com/Prachi5791/Projections.git

2. **Open HTML Files Directly**
- Double-click `index.html`, or  
- Use a local server for best results:
  ```
  npx serve .
  ```
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port shown)

*No build or complex setup neededâ€”just HTML, CSS, and JS.*

## **Usage**
- **Shape Selection:** Use the dropdown to pick your geometric figure.
- **Projection Views:**  
- Explore real-time 3D and orthographic panels.
- Use `Toggle Grid`, `Toggle Wireframe`, and `Toggle Boundaries` for visual preference.
- **Perspective Controls:**  
- Select between one-, two-, or three-point perspective.
- Adjust vanishing points with the sliders and immediately see shape changes.
