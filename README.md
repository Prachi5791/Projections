2. Orthographic Projections Viewer
Key Features Observed:
Shape selection dropdown with multiple 3D objects (Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, and more)
Interactive buttons for toggling grid, wireframe, and boundaries
Multiple views displayed:
3D Perspective View (lower left)
Top View (upper middle)
Front View (upper right)
Side View (lower right)
Grids and colored outlines distinguish different axes for projection views
Clean, modular, and intuitive UI design

3. Perspective Projections Controls
Key Features Observed:
Selection between One-Point, Two-Point, and Three-Point perspective types
Shape selection dropdown (e.g., Cube)
Interactive sliders to adjust Vanishing Points (VP1, VP2, VP3 for X/Y axes)
Visual representation of vanishing points connected to the cube, updating according to slider adjustments
Instructional note under the controls to guide the user
These images collectively demonstrate the comprehensive features, interactivity, and educational focus of your website's viewer for orthographic and perspective projections. If you need captions, alt text, or descriptions for each image, let me know and I can provide those as well!
so give me a proper readme using it

Orthographic & Perspective Projections Viewer
A web application for interactive visualization of 3D shapes with both orthographic and perspective projections. Users can select, manipulate, and study geometric shapes, toggle grid/wireframe settings, and experience real-time adjustment of vanishing points in different perspective modes.

Demo Overview
Orthographic & Perspective Projections Viewer is a visual learning tool that allows users to:
Select different 3D shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, dodecahedron, torus knot, etc.)
Switch between orthographic and three perspective modes (one-, two-, three-point)
Interactively move vanishing points and immediately see changes reflected in the diagram
Toggle grid, wireframe, and boundary overlays for deeper understanding

Features
Wide Shape Selection: Choose from a variety of geometric solids and parametric forms.
Multi-Panel Layout: Instantly view a shape in 3D perspective, top, front, and side orthographic projections.
Perspective Simulation: Adjust 1-, 2-, and 3-point vanishing points via sliders; watch the projection adapt in real time.
UI Controls: Easily toggle grid, wireframe, and shape boundaries for different visualization needs.
Educational Tooltips: Guidance text to aid user learning and experimentation.

No build or complex setup needed—just HTML, CSS, and JS.

Usage
Shape Selection: Choose your geometric figure using the dropdown at the top.
Projection Views:
Explore 3D and orthographic panels side by side.
Use Toggle Grid, Toggle Wireframe, and Toggle Boundaries to highlight different features.
Perspective Controls:
Pick from one-point, two-point, or three-point perspective modes.
Drag sliders to interactively adjust vanishing point positions and observe real-time shape transformation.
